      <article>
        <p>
         Located in the south west coast of India, Kerala is blessed with backwaters, stunning beaches, and endless tea plantations. Kerala literally means “the land of the coconut trees” and is also known as “God’s own country”, and there’s no doubt why it’s called like that after paying a visit. The first thing that grabs your attention in Kerala is its exuberant nature. There are hundreds of coconut trees almost everywhere you look!
